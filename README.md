‚úÖ Your Current Standing:

üéì BS in IT ‚Üí Meets degree requirement for most DoD roles

üõ†Ô∏è 5+ years of experience ‚Üí Meets experience requirement for CISSP

üõ°Ô∏è Likely already have Security+ (SecurityX) ‚Üí IAT Level II


üîë What You Need Next:

To qualify for ISSE (IASAE Level III), you need:

‚û§ Cert to Get: [CISSP-ISSEP]

Step 1: Earn CISSP ‚Äî (ISC)¬≤ Certified Information Systems Security Professional

Step 2: Add ISSEP Concentration ‚Äî specialized in engineering (designed for ISSE roles)

ISSEP = Information Systems Security Engineering Professional

Once you have CISSP-ISSEP, you're 100% compliant for ISSE under 8140 Level 3 (IASAE III).

üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Timeline / Study Plan

Here‚Äôs a sample schedule you could adapt (assuming you can commit part‚Äëtime over ~3‚Äë4 months). Adjust based on how much time per week you can devote.

| Phase                                         | Duration                 | Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phase 1 ‚Äì Review CISSP Domains / Baseline** | \~4‚Äë6 weeks              | Read through one of the full CISSP guides as your primary text. Do small domain by domain study. Take quizzes at the end of each chapter.                                                                                            |
| **Phase 2 ‚Äì Practice + Weak Areas**           | \~2‚Äë3 weeks              | Use practice tests. Identify weak domains. Focus deeper study in those. Use ‚ÄúEleventh Hour‚Äù or similar to reinforce.                                                                                                                 |
| **Phase 3 ‚Äì Start ISSEP prep**                | \~4‚Äë5 weeks              | Enroll in ISSEP self‚Äëpaced course or instructor‚Äëled if possible. Read ISSEP domain material, study engineering lifecycle, risk management, secure planning & design, implementation/validation. Use the ISSEP Study Questions eBook. |
| **Phase 4 ‚Äì Mock Exams + Final Review**       | \~1‚Äë2 weeks              | Take full mock tests (CISSP + ISSEP where applicable). Re‚Äëreview NIST / RMF documents and systems engineering concepts. Flash cards. Ensure you can reason through scenario‚Äëbased questions. Sleep restudy, etc.                     |
| **Phase 5 ‚Äì Exam Time**                       | After you feel confident | Schedule CISSP exam; after passing (or close) schedule ISSEP concentration.                                                                                                                                                          |

‚úÖ Study Tips / Best Practices

Understand, don‚Äôt just memorize: many questions are scenario‚Äëbased (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs best, what‚Äôs first, etc.‚Äù). Understanding flows in RMF, engineering lifecycle, risk, etc. helps more than rote memory.

Use official sources: ISC¬≤‚Äôs exam outline, their self‚Äëpaced training. Helps ensure what you're studying is up to date.

Set milestones: schedule blocks to complete certain domains, complete so many practice questions, etc.

Hands‚Äëon / real experience: your years of experience help a lot. Try to map what you already know into the domains (e.g. if you‚Äôve done risk assessments, system design, validation, etc.) so you can recall practical examples.

Group study / discussion: forums (AMC, Reddit, ISC¬≤), or study partners help to hash out tricky concepts.

Stay current on frameworks: Make sure you're familiar with the current version of NIST SP 800‚Äë53, RMF guidelines, DoD policies if relevant. Information engineering and system architecture topics in ISSEP often pull from these.
