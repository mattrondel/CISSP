Great — with **6 years of experience**, you're in a strong position to qualify for **IASAE II** roles under **DoD 8140**.

Here’s a tailored breakdown for you:

---

## ✅ **You Qualify for IASAE II**

DoD 8140 (which replaced 8570) groups cybersecurity roles into work roles and levels. **IASAE Level II** typically maps to system architects, senior engineers, or similar roles in DoD cybersecurity workforces.

You just need one **approved certification** from the list for **IASAE II**.

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Certs for IASAE II (Under 8140)**

Here are your best options:

| Certification                                                   | Why Choose It                                                            | Notes                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **CISSP** – Certified Information Systems Security Professional | 🔥 **Most recognized** & often preferred for IA architect roles          | Requires 5+ years of experience – ✅ You meet this |
| **CASP+** – CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner              | Easier than CISSP, **no experience required to sit**, still DoD-approved | More technical, less management-focused           |
| **CSSLP** – Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional    | Best if you're focused on **software security & secure SDLC**            | Less common, but fully compliant                  |
| **CISM** – Certified Information Security Manager               | Good if you're heading into management + architecture                    | Less technical than CISSP                         |
| **CCSP** – Certified Cloud Security Professional                | If you work in **cloud security or architecture**                        | Add-on cert, often pursued after CISSP            |

---

## 🔧 Recommendation Based on Your 6 Years:

| Scenario                                         | Best Cert                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| You're a generalist or want best long-term value | ✅ **CISSP**              |
| You're more hands-on, prefer technical work      | ✅ **CASP+**              |
| You work with secure software or SDLC            | ✅ **CSSLP**              |
| You're headed toward cloud system architecture   | ✅ **CCSP** (after CISSP) |

---

## 🛡️ DoD 8140 Mapping (FYI)

8140 now uses the **NICE Framework** with Work Roles and KSATs (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, Tasks), but certs still map to roles like:

* **IASAE II = Work Role ID: 661**
* Official cert matrix: DoD 8140 Baseline Certifications (can link to latest if needed)

--------------------

from chat gpt lvl 3:

🚫 Why SecurityX Doesn’t Qualify:

SecurityX = Entry-level cert (equivalent to legacy Security+)

8140 Level 3 = Senior-level / Architect / Engineer roles

ISSE positions require advanced certifications mapped to the IASAE III category under 8140

SecurityX is mapped only to IAT Level II or IAM Level I in the 8140 framework — not IASAE at all

✅ Your Current Standing:

🎓 BS in IT → Meets degree requirement for most DoD roles

🛠️ 5+ years of experience → Meets experience requirement for CISSP

🛡️ Likely already have Security+ (SecurityX) → IAT Level II


🔑 What You Need Next:

To qualify for ISSE (IASAE Level III), you need:

➤ Cert to Get: [CISSP-ISSEP]

Step 1: Earn CISSP — (ISC)² Certified Information Systems Security Professional

Step 2: Add ISSEP Concentration — specialized in engineering (designed for ISSE roles)

ISSEP = Information Systems Security Engineering Professional

Once you have CISSP-ISSEP, you're 100% compliant for ISSE under 8140 Level 3 (IASAE III).

| Step      | Action                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Step 1  | Confirm Security+ is current (for IAT II baseline)     |
| 🔜 Step 2 | Study for and pass **CISSP**                           |
| 🎯 Step 3 | Add **ISSEP** concentration                            |
| 🚀 Step 4 | Apply to ISSE roles under DoD contracts (8140 Level 3) |


📌 Fast-Track Options:

🧩 Option 1: “Earn CISSP First” Route

Study for and pass CISSP

Apply for ISSE roles (some employers accept CISSP alone temporarily)

While working, prep for and earn ISSEP

🧩 Option 2: “Get Sponsor and Certify Together”

Get a company willing to sponsor you for ISSE

Begin CISSP → ISSEP while on the job (many contracts allow for grace period to certify within 6–12 months)

🧭 Roadmap Summary for You:
Step	Action
✅ Step 1	Confirm Security+ is current (for IAT II baseline)
🔜 Step 2	Study for and pass CISSP
🎯 Step 3	Add ISSEP concentration
🚀 Step 4	Apply to ISSE roles under DoD contracts (8140 Level 3)

ISSEP (CISSP Concentration)

Since ISSEP is more specialized, you’ll want both official and supplementary materials.

🛠️ Proposed Timeline / Study Plan

Here’s a sample schedule you could adapt (assuming you can commit part‑time over ~3‑4 months). Adjust based on how much time per week you can devote.

| Phase                                         | Duration                 | Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phase 1 – Review CISSP Domains / Baseline** | \~4‑6 weeks              | Read through one of the full CISSP guides as your primary text. Do small domain by domain study. Take quizzes at the end of each chapter.                                                                                            |
| **Phase 2 – Practice + Weak Areas**           | \~2‑3 weeks              | Use practice tests. Identify weak domains. Focus deeper study in those. Use “Eleventh Hour” or similar to reinforce.                                                                                                                 |
| **Phase 3 – Start ISSEP prep**                | \~4‑5 weeks              | Enroll in ISSEP self‑paced course or instructor‑led if possible. Read ISSEP domain material, study engineering lifecycle, risk management, secure planning & design, implementation/validation. Use the ISSEP Study Questions eBook. |
| **Phase 4 – Mock Exams + Final Review**       | \~1‑2 weeks              | Take full mock tests (CISSP + ISSEP where applicable). Re‑review NIST / RMF documents and systems engineering concepts. Flash cards. Ensure you can reason through scenario‑based questions. Sleep restudy, etc.                     |
| **Phase 5 – Exam Time**                       | After you feel confident | Schedule CISSP exam; after passing (or close) schedule ISSEP concentration.                                                                                                                                                          |

✅ Study Tips / Best Practices

Understand, don’t just memorize: many questions are scenario‑based (“what’s best, what’s first, etc.”). Understanding flows in RMF, engineering lifecycle, risk, etc. helps more than rote memory.

Use official sources: ISC²’s exam outline, their self‑paced training. Helps ensure what you're studying is up to date.

Cybersecurity Careers
+2

Set milestones: schedule blocks to complete certain domains, complete so many practice questions, etc.

Hands‑on / real experience: your years of experience help a lot. Try to map what you already know into the domains (e.g. if you’ve done risk assessments, system design, validation, etc.) so you can recall practical examples.

Group study / discussion: forums (AMC, Reddit, ISC²), or study partners help to hash out tricky concepts.

Stay current on frameworks: Make sure you're familiar with the current version of NIST SP 800‑53, RMF guidelines, DoD policies if relevant. Information engineering and system architecture topics in ISSEP often pull from these.
